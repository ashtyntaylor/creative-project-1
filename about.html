    <p>Hi!  My name is Khloe and this is my closet!  You're probably wondering what this website is all about.
      Well, let me explain.  This project originally started as a simple way for me to clean out my closet and get rid of all
      the clothes that I was no longer wearing.  I'd post the articles of clothing on my Insta and then sell them to whoever commented first.
      It has sense evolved into what it is today - a thrifting website!</p>
    <p>Still don't get it?  Basically, I do all of the hard work of digging through the old, grungy clothes that you
      find at typical thrift stores, to find the few hidden gems.  Then I gather all of my finds here, just for you.
      Now you can find all of your favorite brands at thrifted prices without any of the hassel.  Enjoy!</p>
